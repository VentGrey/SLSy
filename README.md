# SLSy - Tiny Oak "helmet" middleware 🌳⛑️

> And I know I don't need you now...

## Introduction

SLSy is a tiny middleware for [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/) that acts
as a tiny replacement for the Express.js helmet middleware. Heavily inspired on
snelm which, for some reason is still on Oak's website even after it was
removed.

The Deno version hosted at [deno.land/x/snelm](https://deno.land/x/snelm) last
update was 4 years ago.

I don't know if this is part of Oak itself (doesn't seem to be). Take everything
you see in this repo with a grain of salt.

## Features :star:

- Oak only. No other Deno servers are supported.
- No CORS, browser tasks are for the browser, not the server.
- Hopefully, tiny.
